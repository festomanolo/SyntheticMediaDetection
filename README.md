Project Setup Instructions
Now let's put everything together. Here's how to set up and use the project:
1. Set Up Project Environment
First, create your project directory structure as outlined earlier and set up a virtual environment:

# Create project directory
mkdir lip-sync-detection
cd lip-sync-detection

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt


2. Running the Analysis
There are two ways to use the project:
Command-Line Interface:
# Run analysis on a video file
python app/app.py path/to/video.mp4 --output results
Web UI Dashboard:
# Launch the web UI
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
Data Collection and Testing
For effective lip sync analysis, you'll need:

Test Dataset Creation:

Collect AI-generated videos with known synchronization issues
Create a control set with proper lip synchronization
Annotate videos with ground truth labels


Evaluation Metrics:

False positive rate: How often the system reports sync issues in properly synced videos
False negative rate: How often the system misses actual sync issues
Correlation accuracy: How well the system's confidence score reflects actual sync quality
